# ImagetoImageTranslation

In this work we develop a conditional adversarial network for image translation problems. We demonstrate that this model can synthesize plausible images for many image to-image translation tasks. We compare the results with different losses and validate that a combination of the cGAN loss with there construction distance gives more realistic results
